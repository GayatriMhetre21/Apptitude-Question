1. An exam was conducted and the following was analyzed. 4 men were able to check some exam papers in 8 days working 5 hours regularly. What is the total number of hours taken by 2 men in 20 days to check double the number of exam papers?

Answer: 8 hours

Solution 1:

Assuming that 1 unit of work is done in 1 hour Let’s calculate the total number of working hours: 
=> 4 * 8 * 5 = 160 units Now the work is doubled: => 160 * 2 = 320 units Let ‘x’ be the number of hours taken by 2 men to complete the work in 20 days.
Therefore, => 2 * 20 * x = 320 => x = 8 hours (Answer).

Solution 2:

Let's verify the calculation step by step: 
Calculate the total number of working hours for the original work: 
4 workers work 8 hours per day for 5 days.
Total units of work = 4 × 8 × 5 = 160 4×8×5=160 units.
When the work is doubled: New total units of work = 160 × 2 = 320 160×2=320 units.
Let 𝑥 x be the number of hours taken by 2 men to complete the work in 20 days: Total units of work done by 2 men in 𝑥 x hours per day for 20 days = 2 × 20 × 𝑥 2×20×x.
Set up the equation: 2 × 20 × 𝑥 = 320 2×20×x=320 Solve for 𝑥 x: 40 𝑥 = 320 40x=320 𝑥 = 320 40 x= 40 320 ​ 𝑥 = 8 x=8 
So, 𝑥 = 8 x=8 hours is correct. Two men working for 8 hours a day over 20 days will complete the doubled work.

2. The numbers from 101 to 150 are written as, 101102103104105…146147148149150.
 What will be the remainder when this total number is divided by 3?

Answer: 2

Solution 1:

The divisibility rule for 3 is that the sum of all digits of a number should be divisible by 3.
Let’s calculate the sum of the digits: There are 50 1’s (unit place) = 50 
There are 10 1’s (tens place) = 10 There are 10 2’s (tens place) = 20 
There are 10 3’s (tens place) = 30 There are 10 4’s (tens place) = 40 
There is one 5 (tens place) = 5 For each number 1 to 9, 
there are 5 sets of sum 45(1+2+…+9) = 225 =>
So sum of all digits = 380 => 380 / 3 = 2 (Answer)

Solution 2:

Let's break down the problem and verify the sum of the digits and the divisibility rule for 3.
Calculating the sum of the digits: There are 50 ones in the unit place: 50 × 1 = 50 50×1=50 
There are 10 ones in the tens place: 10 × 1 = 10 10×1=10 
There are 10 twos in the tens place: 10 × 2 = 20 10×2=20
There are 10 threes in the tens place: 10 × 3 = 30 10×3=30 
There are 10 fours in the tens place: 10 × 4 = 40 10×4=40
There is one five in the tens place: 1 × 5 = 5 1×5=5 
Sum of digits for numbers 1 to 9: Each set from 1 to 9 sums to 45. 
There are 5 sets of these numbers: 5 × 45 = 225 5×45=225
Adding all these sums together: Sum of digits in the unit place and tens place: 50 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 5 = 155 50+10+20+30+40+5=155
Adding the sets from 1 to 9: 155 + 225 = 380 155+225=380
Checking divisibility by 3: To determine if 380 is divisible by 3, 
we sum its digits: 3 + 8 + 0 = 11 3+8+0=11 Since 11 is not divisible by 3, 380 is not divisible by 3. 
Therefore, the statement 380 3 = 2 3 380 ​ =2 is incorrect. The correct approach confirms that 380 is not divisible by 3.


3. If the alphabets are written in the sequence of a, bb, ccc, dddd, eeeee, ffffff, …. What will be the 120th letter?

Answer: O

Solution 1:
It can be seen that the letter are in AP sequence, So applying the formula we get, n(n+1)/2 <= 120 
We find that n = 15 fits the equation The 15th letter in the English alphabet = O So 15th term contains O.

4.There is a tank whose 1/7 th part is filled with fuel. If 22 liters of fuel is poured into the tank, 
the indicator rises to 1/5 th mark of the tank. So what is the total capacity of the tank?

Answer: 385

Solution:
Let the total capacity of the tank be ‘x’ liters.
According to the question, => x/7 + 22 = x/5 => x/5 – x/7 = 22 => x = 385 litres(Answer)

5.
In the given figure, find the ratio of area of the square to area of the triangle:a) 3:2 b) 2:3 c) 2:1 d) 1:2

Answer: c) 2:1

Solution:

Let the side of the square be ‘2’ units Area of the square = (side)^2 = 2^2 = 4 unit 
Side of triangle, using Pythagoras Theorem = \sqrt{5} unit 
Height of triangle = side of square (Using Pythagorean theorem) 
Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height here, base = height = side 
Area of triangle = 1/2 * (side)^2 => 1/2 *2 * 2 => 2 units
Therefore the ratio = 4:2 => 2:1 (Answer)
